<h5>CAST Plug-in for Eclipse</h5>

<p>The CAST Plug-in for Eclipse is in fact several plug-ins that can be added to 
Eclipse using the Software Updates and Install new Software options within Eclipse. See
<a href="../install/index.html">Installing and configuring the CAST Plug-in for 
Eclipse</a> for more information.</p>

<h5>Web Service</h5>

<p>The web service is shipped in the form of a .WAR file (called CASTWS.war) 
that is delivered as part of the CAST AIP suite or directly from CAST’s Product 
Center.</p>

<h5>CAST Dashboard Service</h5>

<p>The CAST Dashboard Service should already be populated with data from your ongoing 
analyses. It should also contain violations (i.e. code that violates CAST 
Quality Rules) that have been added to the <b>Action Plan</b> – you can verify this using the CAST  Dashboard.</p>

<h5>CAST Dashboard</h5>

<p>The CAST Dashboard needs to be fully functioning.</p>
<p>If you want (optional) to browse the violations for an object or the objects 
that violate a specific Quality Rule (through the Eclipse browser) as displayed 
in the CAST Dashboard, any developer computer that needs to use the CAST Plug-in 
for Eclipse <b>must also be able to connect to</b> the <b>CAST Dashboard</b> and 
the <b>CAST Web Service</b>.</p>
