<h4>Environment Requirements</h4>
<hr>

<p>To use the CAST Plug-in for Eclipse the following requirements are necessary:</p>

<h5>CAST</h5>

<p>The plug-in is designed to function with the following versions of CAST:</p>

<ul>
  <li>6.4.x</li>
  <li>7.0.x</li>
</ul>

<p>This means you should have a fully functioning CAST installation in one of 
the supported versions. Please see the relevant CAST Installation Guide for more 
information about the installation process for this version.</p>

<p>You also need to have successfully worked through the process of populating 
your CAST Dashboard Service (formerly known as the Central) with information 
that can be accessed via the CAST Dashboard (i.e. have analyzed your source 
code, generated a snapshot and added violations to the Action Plan in the CAST 
Dashboard).</p>

<h5>RDBMS</h5>

<p>The plug-in functions on the following supported RDBMS (please see the 
relevant CAST Release Notes to find out which RDBMS version is supported):</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#111111" width="50%" bordercolorlight="#006699" bordercolordark="#FFFFFF">
  <tr>
    <td width="16%" bgcolor="#C0C0C0"><b>CAST version</b></td>
    <td width="84%" bgcolor="#C0C0C0"><b>Supported RDBMS</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="16%"><b>6.4.x</b></td>
    <td width="84%">
    <ul>
      <li>Oracle Server</li>
      <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="16%"><b>7.0.x</b></td>
    <td width="84%">
    <ul>
      <li>All supported RDBMS including the CAST Storage Service.</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h5>Web Service</h5>

<p>The CAST Plug-in for Eclipse interacts with the CAST Dashboard Service using a <b>web 
service</b> installed on a J2EE compliant application server (such as Apache 
Tomcat). As such, the web service must already be
<a href="../install/webservice.html">installed and configured</a>.</p>

<ul>
      <li>For Oracle Server environments, when
      <a href="../install/webservice.html">configuring</a> 
      the web service, you need to specify the <b>schema</b>, <b>user ID</b> and <b>password</b> 
      that correspond to the schema in which the CAST Dashboard Service has been installed.<li>
  For Oracle Server environments, you must make sure that the user ID you 
  specify when <a href="../install/webservice.html">configuring</a> the web service has the 
  following rights/roles:<ul>
  <li><b>Oracle 10g2</b> = ALTER SESSION. Note that this role is implicitly granted in 
Oracle 10.2.0.1</li>
  <li><b>Other Oracle versions</b> = CONNECT</li></ul>
      <p>This is because the CAST Plug-in for Eclipse modifies the <b>Oracle Optimizer Mode</b> 
      using the following query:<pre><b>alter session set optimizer_mode=ALL_ROWS</b></pre>
</ul>

<h5>J2EE compliant application server</h5>

<p>The CAST Plug-in for Eclipse interacts heavily with the CAST  Dashboard and 
a web service - both of which are installed on a J2EE compliant application 
server (such as Apache Tomcat). 
Please see the relevant CAST Release Notes to find out which 
J2EE compliant application version is supported for <b>CAST 6.4.x</b> and <b>
7.0.x</b>.</p>

<h5>Eclipse</h5>

<p>The plug-in is supported on:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Eclipse 3.4</b></li>
  <li><b>Eclipse 3.5</b></li>
  <li><b>Eclipse 3.6</b></li>
</ul>

<p>You can download Eclipse for 
free: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ </a>CAST recommends the <b>Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers</b>, although the CAST plug-in will 
work with other packages.</p>
