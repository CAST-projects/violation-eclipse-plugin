<h4>CAST Violation List</h4>
<hr>

<p>The <b>CAST Violation List</b> simply lists all the violations that have been 
fetched from the CAST Dashboard Service:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../images/violations.jpg" width="845" height="376"></p>

<p>The following buttons are available:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" bordercolorlight="#006699" bordercolordark="#FFFFFF" height="130">
  <tr>

    <td width="95%" height="19">This button launches the <a href="../manually_fetch.html">Fetching 
    Parameters dialog box</a> in which you can create a filter to fetch only 
    certain violations from the CAST CAST Dashboard Service.</td>
  </tr>

    <td width="5%" align="center" height="21">
    <img border="0" src="../images/icon_fetch.jpg" width="23" height="21"></td>
    <td width="95%" height="21">This button allows you to manually fetch

    fetched the violations, any new violations stored in the CAST Dashboard 
    Service 
    (for example following an overnight code analysis and snapshot generation 
    process) will also be displayed along with any existing violations.</p>
    <p>Note also that if you have a violation filter defined in the  <a href="../manually_fetch.html">Fetching 
    Parameters dialog box</a> (accessed using the
    <img border="0" src="../images/icon_filter.jpg" align="absmiddle" width="23" height="21"> button),

<h5>Double click to view code</h5>

<p><b>Double clicking</b> a violation in the CAST Violation List that concerns a 
Java object (see below for a list of supported object types) will display the corresponding Java object source code at the 
beginning of the declaration within the Eclipse environment. The object will 
also be highlighted.
In 
addition, the <a href="outline.html">CAST Outline View</a> will be populated 
with information regarding the highlighted object (violated Quality Rule, 
corresponding metric etc.). Focus will also be placed on the 
<a href="matching_artifacts.html">CAST 
Matching Artifacts view</a>.</p>

    above for more information about this.<p>The object will also be 
    highlighted. In addition, the <a href="outline.html">CAST Outline View</a>
