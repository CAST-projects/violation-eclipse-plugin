<h4>CAST Matching Artifacts</h4>
<hr>

<p>The <b>CAST Matching Artifacts</b> view indicates all occurrences in the 
current workspace of the artifact referenced in the Java Violation selected in 
the <a href="violation.html">CAST Violation List</a>.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful where you have two similar methods. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>m(String, String)</li>
  <li>m(int, int)</li>
</ul>
<p>The violation will only indicate that &quot;m&quot; is the method causing the issue and 
as such it is difficult to know which method is being referred to. The <b>CAST 
Matching Artifacts</b> view will thus display both methods. You can then double 
click the artifact to view its source code and make appropriate changes.</p>

<p>This view can also help where a method exists in two different files, which 
may be the case if you are working on two different projects and you have two 
identical classes. In this case the view will display both methods and the files 
they belong to.</p>
<p>The <img border="0" src="../images/icon_viewcode.jpg" align="absmiddle" width="23" height="21"> button will display the selected artifact’s corresponding source code if 
available in your workspace (identical to double clicking the item in the list).</p>
