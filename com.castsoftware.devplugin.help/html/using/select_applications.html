<h4>How to select the Applications/Modules and Technologies</h4>
<hr>

<p class="MsoNormal">The first thing you should do prior to fetching the 
violations is to filter the violations that you want to see listed in the
<a href="views/violation.html">CAST Violation List</a>. This is so that you do not fetch 
ALL the violations that have been flagged in the Central  as some may not be 
related to your application, module or technology and therefore may not be of 
interest.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the <a href="views/violation.html">CAST Violation List</a>, select the
  <img border="0" src="images/icon_filter.jpg" align="absmiddle" width="23" height="21"> 
  button:<br>
  <br>
  <img border="0" src="images/icon_filter_large.jpg" width="825" height="26"></li>
  <li>This will launch the <b>Fetching Parameters dialog box</b> in which you 
  have to select both <b>Applications/Modules</b> and <b>Technologies </b>as 
  defined during the code analysis phase:<br>
  <img border="0" src="images/fetch_param.jpg" width="624" height="417"></li>
  <li>Select the <b>Applications/Modules</b> and <b>Technologies </b>that you 
  require (you must select Applications/Modules <b>AND</b> Technologies). Selecting 
  nothing will cause the <b>OK</b> button to be disabled.</li>
  <li>Click <b>OK </b>when you are satisfied with your choices.</li>
  <li>The
  <a href="views/violation.html">CAST Violation List</a> will then automatically display all the violations that 
  match the criteria you selected:<br>

</ul>

  Notes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Note that you can modify the violation filter at anytime using the 
  <img border="0" src="images/icon_filter.jpg" align="absmiddle" width="23" height="21"> button 
  in the <a href="views/violation.html">CAST Violation List</a>.</li>
  <li>Please also remember that <b>only Quality Rule based violations</b> will be fetched 
  into the <a href="views/violation.html">CAST Violation List</a> and not metric based violations.</li>
</ul>
